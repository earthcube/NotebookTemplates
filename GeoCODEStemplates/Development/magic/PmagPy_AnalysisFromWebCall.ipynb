    "This notebook is intended to be an illustrative case study of simple data analysis that can be accomplished using PmagPy within a Jupyter notebook. All the capabilities of PmagPy can be utilized within notebooks, although continued work is needed for the functionality within some of the command line programs to be made into functions that work well within the environment.\n",

    "An advantage of this type of workflow is that it is well-documented and reproducible. The decisions that went into the data analysis and the implementation of the statistical tests are fully transparent (as is the underlying code). Additionally, if one were to seek to add more data to the mean pole, all of the data analysis could be quickly redone by executing all of the code in the notebook.\n",
